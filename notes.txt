1. Running AIR Balance per Borrower per day
2. Voiding Payments/Bounced Check
    Sample:
        Loan = 18110004
        Amortization Item = 429
        Payment ID = 10
    - Amortization Item Update fails due to Payment Serializer Create function Line 557
    - Offset Payment counts to Total Amount Paid by Borrower
3. Manually Edit of Amortization Items -  DONE
    - Needs function call for PMT on Input to fetch proper Amortization Item Amounts
    - UI Still shows up to 3 decimal points
    - Does not update the whole value of the loan, just the value of the Amortization item
    - Still needs Entry Logs Once Approved
4. Disable Payment Priority for Penalty (i.e. Penalty Payments can be paid on Last Amortization Schedule)
    - Removed ng-disabled on AI, Interest and Principal Payment when Penalty Payment is Zero during Payment with Penalty

5. Input Current AIR Balance at the End of Month



AIR Balance Updated Formula
Interest Rate per Day formula on Column "U" on Excel file
Interest Rate per Day * Number of Days till Cutoff = AIR Balance
